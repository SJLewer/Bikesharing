# Bikesharing
## Project Overview
Citi Bike in New York City is the largest bike-sharing program in the nation and has been very successful.  Could Citi Bike's success be replicated in Des Moines, IA?  This project will begin the feasiblity analysis by learning about Citi Bike customers.

### Data Preparation
The dataset is August 2019 New York City Citibike trip data available on-line at: https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data
The datatype for two fields needs to be changed:  tripduration from an integer to datetime and gender from an integer to a string.  To retain the original data, two new fields ("triptime" and "genderstr") were created for the revised datatypes.
